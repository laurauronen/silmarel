Welcome to silmarel's documentation!
====================================

**silmarel** is a package intended to make
multi-messenger lensing analyses smooth and easy
to achieve. To this end, we incorporate both 
usual EM lens reconstruction packages with the 
typical data products of lensed GW analyses.

The package also contains likelihoods designed
for multi-messenger lens reconstruction.

Currently-incorporated packages include: 

- EM: lenstronomy, herculens
- GW: golum-JPE

   This project is under active development.
